As a driver, I want to renew my vehicle registration online so that I can avoid visiting a service center in person.

Acceptance Criteria:

The system must allow the driver to view the status of their current registration.

The system should provide a renewal option if the registration is due within 30 days or has expired.

Upon successful renewal, the system must generate a digital confirmation receipt and email it to the driver.
